# **basinPhysiographics**


## Description

The ***basinPhysiographics*** package was developed to compile functions aimed at obtaining the physiographic characteristics of a territory, typically a basin in hydrology. Currently, the package assists users in obtaining digital elevation subproducts and delineating watershed basins.

This package is a voluntary initiative by a group of Brazilian hydrologists and is part of the <a href="https://github.com/hydroversebr/">hydroversebr</a> project. We welcome contributions from enthusiasts. If you're interested in joining the team and helping us develop this project, please contact us.

## Installing this package

You can download and install the most up-to-date version directly from this repository. The procedure is
1. Install the package "devtools" (you only have to do this once. Note that this will also install several dependancies)
2. Load the devtools library
3. Install the package.

The commands are:
``` R
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("hydroversebr/basinPhysiographics")
```
