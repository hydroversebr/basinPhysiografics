\usage{
historicalStatistics(
  selectStationsResultSeries,
  statistics = "Qmean",
  basedOn = "waterYear",
  permanence = 95,
  pReturn = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{selectStationsResultSeries}{list, tibble data frame; provides a list containing
the data frames of filtered records for each station
(series output from \code{\link[=selectStations]{selectStations()}} function).}

\item{statistics}{character; indicates statistics.
\itemize{
\item The supported statistics for streamflow are:
(1) mean stream flow (Qmean);
(2) minimum of seven-day moving average of daily stream flow associated with return period (Q7T);
(3) stream flow associated with a percentage of time (Qperm);
(4) maximum stream flow (Qmax);
(5) minimum stream flow (Qmin).
\item The supported statistics are:
(1) total rainfall (Rtotal);
(2)  maximum rainfall (Rmax);
(3) rainy days (Rdays).
\item The default value is "Qmean".
}}

\item{basedOn}{character; indicate if statistics must evaluated considering year ("wateryear") or month ("monthwateryear"). Default is "wateryear".}

\item{permanence}{numeric; percentage of time if "Qperm" is choose as statistic parameter.
The default is 95 percent.}

\item{pReturn}{numeric; return period if "Q7T" is choose as statistic parameter.
The default is 10 year.}
}
\value{
A list containing 3 objects:
\itemize{
\item a list containing statistic a data frame \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}} object for each station.
\item a data frame \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}} with statistic of all stations in wide format.
\item a data frame \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}} with statistic of all stations in longer format.

\description{
Takes as input a list containing data frames of organized and filtered records
for each station (output from \code{\link[=selectStations]{selectStations()}}) and compute historical
streamflow or rainfall statistics
}
\details{
Q7T is evaluated based on empirical distribution using Kimbal method.
